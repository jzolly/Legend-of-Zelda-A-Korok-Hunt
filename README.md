After the hunt has begun, users may need a reminder of how many koroks, or what they are supposed to be doing.  The reminder menu button appears after the quest has begun and dispalys alternative text.

#### Clues and Korok Locations
Each korok is designed to only appear after the user has followed clues, all mechanics of the original Breath of the Wild experience for finding all 900 ingame koroks.  After finding a Korok users may keep clicking them to dive deep into the API to get fact after fact within that koroks category, or click the button to keep interacting with the rest of the page.

#### Customized Images
***Procreate*** is the technology used to color edit the images to match their background and seemlessly blend with the game map. Each image was originally from **game screenshots** which were then converted into custome png files.
