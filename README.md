#### How to Play-menus
This first menu serves as the launch point for the viewer.  The game is coded so that the backbround cannot be interacted with until the user intitialized the quest.

After the hunt has begun, users may need a reminder of how many koroks, or what they are supposed to be doing.  The reminder menu button appears after the quest has begun and dispalys alternative text.
